## ðŸ“– About This Repo

This repository is a **hands-on demonstration of dynamically fetching external HTML files** and displaying them as **beautifully highlighted code snippets** using **Prism.js**.  

### What this repo contains:

1. **`index.html`** â€“ The main page that:
   - Fetches an external HTML file (`hello.html`) using JavaScript  
   - Escapes HTML characters so the code displays correctly  
   - Uses Prism.js to highlight the code dynamically  

2. **`hello.html`** â€“ An example HTML file to be fetched:
   - Contains the **full HTML structure** including `<!DOCTYPE html>`  
   - Serves as the content displayed in the Prism.js snippet  

3. **`README.md`** â€“ This professional documentation file  

4. **Optional `assets/` folder** â€“ Can contain images, CSS, or other resources  

This repo is perfect for **students, developers, and documentation authors** who want to showcase full HTML code dynamically with **professional syntax highlighting**.
